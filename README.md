ML-Based Supplier Selection for Low-Carbon Waste Logistics in Cement Plants
A Forecast-Aware Decision Strategy under Fixed Operational Constraints


Research Project

February 2026

Project Summary:
This project studies transport-related CO₂ emission reduction in waste co-processing logistics for cement plants. A fixed daily waste collection target must be met using suppliers located at different distances with variable waste availability. Two approaches are compared: a distance-first baseline heuristic and a forecast-aware decision strategy using lightweight machine learning. Performance is evaluated using a rolling 30-day simulation, with cumulative transport-related CO₂ emissions as the primary metric. The results show that forecast-aware supplier selection can achieve realistic and measurable emission reductions without changing fleet size, routing structure, or operational constraints.
